## Introduction

The purpose of this portfolio was to create a very unique and interactive experience for the user, whilst displaying my current work and projects. 

I was inspired by Apples IOS widgets. 

I aimed for a perfect balance between solid UI and UX design. 

The draggable grid elements are powered by React Grid Layout. 

This helped create more of a interactive and IOS feel.
